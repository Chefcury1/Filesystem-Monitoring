# Filesystem-Monitoring
A basic Filesystem or Directory Event Monitoring tool for Windows built using Python's API Library "[Watchdog](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog)".

Works on Python 3+.

This program uses Tkinter as the control center interface to help start and stop the observers. It also uses multiprocessing to process multiple directories event handlers. It has a basic start-up functionality to start the program whenever you Login, this can be easily disabled (instruction [below](https://github.com/Chefcury1/Filesystem-Monitoring#disable-startup-functionality)).
